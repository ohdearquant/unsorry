# Contributing to unsorry

Agents and humans contribute the same way: **claim a goal, open a PR, and let the
gates decide.** Nobody has to trust your machine — the Lean kernel re-verifies every
contribution in CI (Gate A), so a careless or even adversarial PR cannot poison the
library. Human review, where it happens at all, is for naming and duplication, never
for correctness.

There are three ways to contribute, in rough order of involvement:

1. [Run an agent](#running-an-agent) — point a Claude instance at the queue, or prove a goal yourself.
2. [Propose a target](#proposing-a-target) — suggest a theorem worth proving.
3. [Sponsor an upstream](#upstreaming-to-mathlib) — take a proved lemma into mathlib (the one task that requires a human, by mathlib policy).

All work follows [`docs/protocols.md`](docs/protocols.md): an ADR for every significant
decision, a spec per ADR, TDD, feature branches, and a changelog entry per release.

## Running an agent

> **Status: live.** The loop is running and the swarm has proved theorems not already
> in mathlib. Because the kernel re-checks everything in CI, you can run an agent
> against this repo without anyone trusting your machine.

**Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (headless `claude`,
authenticated — a subscription works, no API key required), the
[Lean toolchain](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html) via `elan`
(the pinned version installs automatically from `lean-toolchain`), the
[`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) CLI authenticated, and Python 3.12.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agenticsnz/unsorry && cd unsorry
lake exe cache get                       # fetch prebuilt mathlib (minutes; never builds from source)
lake build                               # verify the current library locally
python3 -m tools.gate_b validate .       # check coordination artifacts (Gate B)
./swarm/agent.sh --prove --once          # claim a goal, prove it, open an auto-merge PR
```

`--prove` claims an open `prove`-phase goal, drives `claude` to write a Lean proof,
self-verifies it locally (`lake build --wfail` + the axiom audit) before opening a PR,
and lets the gates decide. Other flags:

- `--translate-only` — run the Phase-0/1 formalisation loop instead of proving.
- `--dry-run` — show what would be claimed without claiming.
- `--once` — run a single cycle (omit to loop until the budget is spent or no goal is claimable).
- `--self-test` — check your setup (hermetic; no network, no `claude`).

For unattended runs, **[`./swarm/supervise.sh --prove --goal <id>`](swarm/supervise.sh)**
wraps the agent loop with backoff across infrastructure outages, in-flight waits for
merges, and PR hygiene (ADR-017) — it drives a goal tree to closure with one command.

An agent session loads `swarm/protocol.aisp` (the coordination contract) plus the AISP
grammar reference ([AI_GUIDE.md](https://github.com/bar181/aisp-open-core/blob/main/AI_GUIDE.md),
~19 KB) at start. Note: from 2026-06-15, headless `claude -p` on subscription plans draws
from a separate Agent SDK credit pool — size your run accordingly.

### Model & effort policy

Proof-surface calls default to the most capable model (`fable`) on a progressive effort
ladder (`high → xhigh → max`, one rung per attempt) — see
[ADR-013](docs/adrs/ADR-013-Model-Effort-Policy.md) / [ADR-015](docs/adrs/ADR-015-Progressive-Effort-Escalation.md).
Override with `UNSORRY_MODEL` / `UNSORRY_EFFORT`; both degrade fail-soft on CLIs without `--effort`.

## Proposing a target

The open targets live on the **[targets board](docs/targets.md)** — theorems already
proven somewhere but not yet in mathlib, vetted for absence and stated in Lean. Pick one
and prove it, or point an agent at the queue.

To suggest a new target, open a
[propose-target issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/propose-target.md). How targets are sourced
and machine-checked for mathlib-absence is [ADR-012](docs/adrs/ADR-012-Backlog-Sourcing.md);
absence is a grep **pre-filter**, not a proof — the definitive check is downstream (a target
already in mathlib gets discharged by a one-line citation rather than a real proof).

## Upstreaming to mathlib

Getting a proved lemma *into* mathlib is the one place a human is required, by
[mathlib's AI-contribution policy](https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html):
AI use must be disclosed, the PR carries the `LLM-generated` label, and the author must
understand the proof and write the PR and review replies **in their own words** —
LLM-written conversation is not allowed, and autonomous LLM PRs get summarily closed.

So unsorry splits the work along that line. The **machine** prepares an
[upstream packet](docs/upstream/) (a `git apply`-able patch, gate evidence, a factual
disclosure block) and a **[one-command draft-PR helper](docs/upstreaming.md#step-by-step-with-the-commands)**;
a human **sponsor** owns the understanding, the Zulip thread, the PR narrative, and the
vouching. The full step-by-step — what is automatic and what is irreducibly yours — is
**[docs/upstreaming.md](docs/upstreaming.md)**. Autonomous unsorry→mathlib PRs are a
permanent non-goal.

## Development protocols

Every change, however small, follows [`docs/protocols.md`](docs/protocols.md):

- **One ADR per significant decision** in [`docs/adrs/`](docs/adrs/), in the WH(Y) format, with rejected alternatives recorded; a **spec** per ADR captures the "how".
- **TDD** — tests before implementation; the agent loop (`./swarm/agent.sh --self-test`), the supervisor (`./swarm/supervise.sh --self-test`), and the Python tools (`python3 -m pytest tools -q`) all stay green.
- **Feature branch + PR** for everything; no direct commits to `main`.
- **Changelog** entry under `[Unreleased]` for every user-facing change ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), SemVer).
- **README accuracy** — features described must exist; docs change in the same branch as the code.

The two CI gates that decide every PR:

- **Gate A (soundness):** `lake build --wfail`, an axiom audit against the `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` whitelist, leanchecker kernel replay, a regenerated statement-binding obligation ([ADR-011](docs/adrs/ADR-011-Statement-Binding-Gate.md)), and goal-statement immutability ([ADR-018](docs/adrs/ADR-018-Goal-Statement-Immutability.md)). Red-team-proven three times.
- **Gate B (hygiene):** the deterministic AISP validator over coordination artifacts ([`tools/gate_b`](tools/gate_b)).
