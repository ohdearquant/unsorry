# GCD / coprimality / Euclidean identities — candidate backlog (Identity Engine)

Theme staging file for the Identity Engine (#400, ADR-043). 23 vetted candidates — each **absence-clean** (no name/content match in pinned mathlib `c5ea00351c` or our goal set) and screened **non-trivial** (ADR-035 battery). The expensive gates (intended proof compiling under `lake env lean` + adversarial skeptic) run at promotion. Scoped 2026-06-15.

- [x] `coprime_n_sq_n_add_one` — n is coprime to n squared plus n plus one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: Rewrite n^2+n+1 = n*(n+1)+1 and reduce gcd via Nat.Coprime / gcd_add_mul_right to gcd n 1 = 1 · conf: high
- [x] `coprime_2n1_3n2` — 2n+1 and 3n+2 are always coprime
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: Bezout: 3*(2n+1) - 2*(3n+2) = -1, so any common divisor divides 1; reduce gcd by subtraction · conf: high
- [x] `coprime_2n1_2n3` — Two consecutive odd numbers 2n+1 and 2n+3 are coprime
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: Common divisor divides their difference 2 and an odd number, so divides gcd(2,odd)=1; gcd_rec reduction · conf: high
- [x] `coprime_3n1_4n1` — 3n+1 and 4n+1 are always coprime
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 4*(3n+1) - 3*(4n+1) = 1, so the gcd divides 1; reduce via Nat.Coprime gcd subtraction lemmas · conf: high
- [x] `coprime_n_cube_add_one` — n is coprime to n cubed plus one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: n^3+1 = n*n^2 + 1, so gcd n (n*n^2+1) = gcd n 1 = 1 via the add-multiple gcd reduction · conf: high
- [ ] `coprime_nsq1_n1` — If n squared plus one is coprime to n plus one then n is odd
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: n^2+1 ≡ 2 mod (n+1) since n ≡ -1, so coprimality forces n+1 odd; contrapose on parity via ZMod/omega · conf: high
- [ ] `coprime_consec_tri` — The odd number 2n+1 is coprime to the product n(n+1)
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 2n+1 is coprime to n and to n+1 separately (each a Bezout 1-step), then Nat.Coprime.mul_right · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_n2_2n5_eq_one` — The gcd of n+2 and 2n+5 is always one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 2n+5 = 2*(n+2) + 1, so gcd reduces to gcd (n+2) 1 = 1 via gcd_add_mul / Nat.gcd_rec · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_3n1_9n4_eq_one` — The gcd of 3n+1 and 9n+4 is always one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 9n+4 = 3*(3n+1) + 1, so gcd (3n+1) (9n+4) = gcd (3n+1) 1 = 1 · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_5n2_7n3_eq_one` — The gcd of 5n+2 and 7n+3 is always one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 7*(5n+2) - 5*(7n+3) = -1; chase the Euclidean reduction so a common divisor divides 1 · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_4n3_6n5_eq_one` — The gcd of 4n+3 and 6n+5 is always one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 3*(4n+3) - 2*(6n+5) = -1; a common divisor divides 1, so the gcd is 1 via subtraction steps · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_2n3_4n5_dvd_two` — The gcd of 2n+3 and 4n+5 always divides 2
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 4n+5 = 2*(2n+3) - 1, so any common divisor divides 1, hence the gcd divides 2 (in fact equals 1) · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_n2_n4_dvd_two` — The gcd of n+2 and n+4 always divides 2
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: gcd (n+2) (n+4) divides their difference 2, via Nat.dvd_sub and gcd_dvd properties · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_n_add_six_dvd_six` — The gcd of n and n+6 always divides 6
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: gcd n (n+6) divides the difference (n+6)-n = 6; use gcd_dvd_right minus gcd_dvd_left and Nat.dvd_sub · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_sq_n_sq_n_one` — n squared is coprime to n squared plus n plus one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: n^2 coprime to n+1 and to n^2+n+1 (each via add-multiple reduction); combine with Nat.Coprime.pow / mul · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_three_pow_succ_three_pow_add_one` — Three to the n+1 is coprime to three to the n plus one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: 3^(n+1) is a power of 3; show 3 is coprime to 3^n+1 (it is 1 mod 3), then Nat.Coprime.pow_left · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_two_pow_add_one_sub_one_dvd_two` — The gcd of 2^n+1 and 2^n-1 always divides 2
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: Their difference is 2 (for n ≥ 1); a common divisor divides 2; handle n=0 separately, then gcd-divides-difference · conf: high
- [ ] `gcd_n_factorial_succ_eq_one` — For positive n, n is coprime to n factorial plus one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: n divides n! (Nat.dvd_factorial), so gcd n (n!+1) = gcd n 1 = 1 via the add-multiple reduction · conf: high
- [ ] `coprime_le_factorial_succ` — Any k between 1 and n is coprime to n factorial plus one
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: k divides n! (Nat.dvd_factorial h1 h2), so gcd k (n!+1) = gcd k 1 = 1; the key step is the dvd_factorial lemma · conf: med
- [ ] `gcd_fib_add_two_eq_gcd_fib_succ` — gcd(F_n, F_{n+2}) equals gcd(F_n, F_{n+1})
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: fib (n+2) = fib (n+1) + fib n; rewrite then use Nat.gcd_add_self_right / add-multiple gcd reduction · conf: high
- [ ] `fib_dvd_fib_two_mul` — F_n divides F_{2n}
      absence: no-local-match · triviality: non-trivial · intended: Apply Nat.fib_dvd with the witness n ∣ 2*n (Dvd.intro 2), discharging the divisibility hypothesis · conf: high
