# Telescoping sums & products — candidate backlog (Identity Engine)

Theme staging file for the Identity Engine (#400, ADR-043). 22 vetted candidates — each **absence-clean** (no name/content match in pinned mathlib `c5ea00351c` or our goal set) and screened **non-trivial** (ADR-035 battery). The expensive gates (intended proof compiling under `lake env lean` + adversarial skeptic) run at promotion. Scoped 2026-06-15.
