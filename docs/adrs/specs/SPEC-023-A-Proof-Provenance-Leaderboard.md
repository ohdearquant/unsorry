# SPEC-023-A: Proof Provenance and Community Statistics

Implements: [ADR-023](../ADR-023-Proof-Provenance-Leaderboard.md) · Status: Living · Updated: 2026-06-13

## Verified-output surface

New automated proof index records append an optional provenance block:

```text
⟦Π:Provenance⟧{
  solver≜<github-login>
  agent≜<swarm-agent-id>
  provider≜<provider-id>
  model≜<effective-model>      # omitted when not exposed
  effort≜<final-effort>
  attempts≜<successful-attempt-number>
  solve_s≜<proof-and-local-verification-seconds>
}
```

Existing index entries remain valid and are reported as historical/unknown.
`solver` defaults to the authenticated `gh api user` login and can be
overridden with `UNSORRY_SOLVER`. Unknown models are omitted, never guessed.

Historical git add-author attribution may be generated for gamified proof
credit when a proof index record lacks solver provenance. Explicit `solver≜`
provenance wins; git-derived credit must not populate or rewrite `solver≜`.

## Terminal-run fact table

Every coordinated proof run that reaches a durable outcome PR appends:

```text
proof-runs/<goal>.<agent>.<run-id>.aisp

𝔸5.1.run.<goal>.<agent>.<run-id>@<date>
γ≔unsorry.proof.run
⟦Ω:Run⟧{id≜<run-id>; goal≜<goal>; agent≜<agent>; outcome≜proved|decomposed|failed}
⟦Π:Provenance⟧{solver≜<github-login>; provider≜<provider>; model≜<optional>; effort≜<optional>}
⟦Γ:Goal⟧{goal≜<goal>}
⟦Λ:Metrics⟧{attempts≜<positive-int>; solve_s≜<non-negative-int>; ended≜<ISO-8601-UTC>}
⟦Σ:Artifact⟧{sha≜<proved-index-sha-or-empty>}
⟦Ε⟧⟨δ≜0.60;τ≜◊⁺⟩
```

The `⟦Γ:Goal⟧` goal-link is one of the five canonical AISP-5.1 blocks
(Ω/Σ/Γ/Λ/Ε); carrying it keeps the record valid under the generic upstream
validator (`aisp-validator`, ADR-003) — without it the advisory cross-check
rejects every run for a missing Γ block.

The fact is committed in the proof PR, accepted decomposition PR, or
affinity-demotion PR. If proof attempts were exhausted but decomposition then
hits infrastructure, a telemetry-only PR records the failed proof run without
changing goal state. Failed attempts are derived without redundant storage:

- proved run: `attempts - 1`;
- decomposed or failed run: `attempts`.

Infrastructure failures are excluded under ADR-016 because they provide no
evidence about goal difficulty or provider capability. Local-only smoke runs
are excluded because they perform no remote operation. A run that fails before
the first provider attempt is also excluded.

`solve_s` starts when `run_proof` begins and ends at local proof verification or
terminal proof failure. It excludes claim waiting, decomposition generation,
PR checks, and merge latency.

## Validation

Gate B `GB019` validates optional successful-proof provenance. `GB020` validates
terminal-run identity, goal references, outcome, attribution, attempts, elapsed
time, completion timestamp, and artifact linkage. Neither surface participates
in statement hashing, Gate A, proof status, affinity, candidate ranking, or any
other trust decision.

## Statistics products

`python3 -m tools.leaderboard --write` deterministically writes:

- `docs/metrics/community-stats.json`: schema-versioned base statistics;
- `docs/metrics/leaderboard-ui.json`: browser-facing leaderboard payload;
- `docs/metrics/attribution-gaps.json`: review queue for proof index files
  missing explicit solver provenance;
- `docs/leaderboard.md`: a human view generated from the same calculations;
- `docs/leaderboard.svg`: README-compatible preview image.

`--json` prints the machine-readable statistics and `--check` detects drift in
all generated leaderboard files.

The base statistics include:

- verified-output and run-telemetry coverage;
- terminal outcome counts, run success rate, attempt yield, failed attempts,
  total/median/p90 solve time, and successes per recorded run hour;
- queue status and difficulty distributions;
- contributor, provider/model, effort-rung, difficulty, and daily cohorts;
- credited contributor ranking that combines explicit solver provenance with
  inferred git add-author credit only when `solver≜` is missing;
- goal-level accumulated runs, failed attempts, and recorded time;
- the latest terminal runs for operational inspection.

Leaderboard rank uses verified proof count, then summed goal-difficulty points.
Failed effort is visible but cannot improve rank, which avoids rewarding
deliberate repeated failure.

## Automation (post-merge refresh)

The generated leaderboard artifacts are **not** regenerated or gated in PRs.
Like the targets board (ADR-036) and the proofs visualisation (ADR-032), they
are refreshed **post-merge** by `.github/workflows/leaderboard.yml`: on a push to
`main` that touches `goals/**`, `library/index/**`, `proof-runs/**`,
`docs/metrics/contributor-aliases.json`, or `tools/leaderboard/**`, the workflow
runs `tools.leaderboard --check .` and, on drift, runs `--write .` and commits
the artifacts back to `main` as a single docs-only `docs: refresh leaderboard
[skip ci]` commit. `swarm/agent.sh::submit_pr_tree` therefore does not regenerate
or stage the leaderboard, and `gate-b.yml` carries no leaderboard `--check`
gate — regenerating the leaderboard in every goal PR made any two concurrent goal
PRs conflict on `docs/leaderboard.*` (exactly the churn #415 removed for the
board). The hand-authored `docs/leaderboard.html` surface fetches the generated
JSON at view time, so it stays consistent without being regenerated. As with the
other two post-merge workflows, the Actions token must be permitted to push to
`main`.

## Interpretation limits

Rates use only logged post-adoption runs. Historical failures are never inferred
from Git authorship, commits, or PR mergers. Provider/model comparisons are
observational and confounded by goal difficulty, contributor choices, retries,
and small sample sizes.

The completion timestamp supports future trend and retention analysis. Better
cost-effectiveness, retry-escalation, hardware, energy, and token analysis would
require additional per-attempt fields. Cross-project work-unit credits would
also require an anti-abuse and verification design before becoming rewards.
