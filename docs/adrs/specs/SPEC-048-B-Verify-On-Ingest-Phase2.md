# SPEC-048-B: Verify-on-Ingest Phase 2 — Incremental Push + Scheduled Backstop + Routine Runner Sizing

Implements: [ADR-048](../ADR-048-Verify-On-Ingest.md) (Phase 2) · Status: Living · Updated: 2026-06-15

## Behaviour

ADR-048 Phase 1 made archive moves provenance-only (no kernel replay). Phase 2 finishes the
verify-on-ingest shift so routine Gate A fits the constrained `unsorry-1` runner and the 16 GB profile
(`namespace-profile-unsorry-2`) becomes optional:

1. **Push to `main` becomes incremental.** Previously every push to `main` ran a FULL kernel replay +
   FULL axiom audit (the post-merge backstop). It now replays/audits only the **pushed diff** — the
   changed library modules + their reverse-import closure (ADR-033) — exactly like a PR. The base is
   `github.event.before` (the previous `main` tip), so for a squash-merge the diff is precisely the
   merged change.
2. **A scheduled full replay is the new backstop.** `gate-a-full-replay.yml` runs daily (and on
   `workflow_dispatch`), replaying + auditing the WHOLE active library (no `--base`) and re-validating
   every archive package. This is the defense-in-depth re-derivation of soundness that the incremental
   push no longer does inline.
3. **Routine runs route to the 4 GB profile.** `detect.profile` sends both proof PRs and push-to-`main`
   to `namespace-profile-unsorry-1` (4 GB). Only an **olean-invalidating** change
   (`lean-toolchain`, `lakefile.toml`, `lakefile.lean`, `lake-manifest.json` — the
   `forces_full_replay` set) forces a FULL replay and routes to `namespace-profile-unsorry-2` (16 GB).
4. **A full replay can fit a constrained runner via a small chunk.** `UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK` overrides
   `REPLAY_CHUNK_SIZE` so the serial full replay splits into smaller chunks; leanchecker holds ~all of
   mathlib resident per process, so a smaller chunk trims the few-olean peak on top of that image. The
   scheduled backstop sets it to `6`.

## Implementation

### `tools/gate_a/parallel_modules.py`

- `REPLAY_CHUNK_SIZE` is computed by `_replay_chunk_size()`, which reads `UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK`
  (default `30`). A missing, non-integer, zero, or negative value falls back to `30` — a bad value can
  never disable chunking into one unbounded `leanchecker` process.
- `replay()` calls `_replay_chunk_size()` at run time (not the import-time constant) so the env
  override is honoured in-process.
- **No change** to the incremental scoping (`scoped_targets`, `scoped_audit_targets`,
  `forces_full_replay`, `forces_full_audit`): the PR-time kernel replay and audit are byte-for-byte the
  same. `#792` already narrowed `forces_full_replay` to the olean-invalidating set, so
  `tools/gate_a/**` and `gate-a.yml` changes run an incremental replay.

### `.github/workflows/gate-a.yml`

- `detect.filter.infra` is narrowed to exactly `{lean-toolchain, lakefile.toml, lakefile.lean,
  lake-manifest.json}` (drops `tools/gate_a/**` and `.github/workflows/gate-a.yml`, which `#792` made
  incremental).
- `detect.profile` routes to `unsorry-2` **only** when `infra == true`; everything else (including push
  to `main`) goes to `unsorry-1`.
- `gate_a_audit` and `gate_a_replay` set
  `BASE_SHA = pull_request.base.sha` on a PR, `github.event.before` on a push, empty otherwise. The
  step runs the FULL command when `BASE_SHA` is empty **or** the zero-SHA
  (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, i.e. first push / branch creation); otherwise the
  incremental `--base "$BASE_SHA"` command. The existing two-branch command structure is preserved.
- `gate_a_archive` uses the **same `BASE_SHA` rule** as audit/replay: `pull_request.base.sha` on a PR,
  `github.event.before` on a push, empty otherwise — and the zero-SHA (first push / branch creation) or
  an empty `BASE_SHA` falls back to validating **all** archive packages (never relying on implicit
  `git diff <zero-sha>` behaviour on a soundness path). On a PR it validates provenance + packaging for
  the changed archives; on a normal push it is usually a no-op (no archive changed). Provenance
  enforcement at archive-introducing PRs is not weakened.

### `.github/workflows/gate-a-full-replay.yml` (new)

- `schedule: cron "11 4 * * *"` (daily) + `workflow_dispatch`; `concurrency: gate-a-full-replay`
  (`cancel-in-progress: false` — never abort an in-flight backstop).
- `runs-on: namespace-profile-unsorry-1` (4 GB); `env.UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK: "6"`;
  `timeout-minutes: 180`.
- Steps mirror `gate_a_replay`: checkout `fetch-depth: 0`, Namespace `.lake` volume (ADR-046),
  best-effort swap, `lean-action` build of `UnsorryGoals`, statement-binding generation,
  `lake build UnsorryLibrary --wfail`, then **full** `audit` and **full** `replay` (no `--base`), then
  `archive_packages validate-changed` (no `--base` = all archives, packaging from scratch).
- Failure surfaces per repo convention (cf. `reaper.yml`): `set -euo pipefail` + job failure → red
  scheduled run.

## Transition / compatibility

- **Zero-gap, additive:** the scheduled backstop ships in the **same** branch as the incremental-push
  change, so there is never a window with no full re-verify path. The push that lands this change still
  runs through Gate A.
- **PR-incremental path unchanged:** proof PRs replay/audit exactly as before.
- **Works after downscale:** routing depends only on the path filter, not on a hidden runner size. The
  current operator model keeps `unsorry-1` at 4 GB for routine incremental work and `unsorry-2` at
  16 GB for forced full replay. The scheduled backstop uses the small-chunk path on `unsorry-1`.
- **`unsorry-2` is optional:** only forced full-replay (toolchain/dep) PRs route there. If the operator
  retires `unsorry-2`, repoint those runs at `unsorry-1` and add `UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK` (e.g. `6`) so
  the rare full replay fits the constrained routine runner — nothing on the routine path depends on the 16 GB profile.
- **Provenance check unchanged:** `archive_proof_provenance` still runs at every archive PR.

## Safety

Lean soundness is unchanged. Every proof is still kernel-replayed once by the trusted pipeline under
its pinned toolchain/mathlib — now at PR time and re-verified on the pushed diff, plus the daily full
backstop. A context change (ADR-033 triggers) still forces a full re-verify. The risk shift is the same
*bookkeeping* risk ADR-048 already accepted (knowing the on-`main` olean is the verified one), now
backstopped daily instead of per-push. The trust boundary remains "CI verified this exact artifact +
immutability," never a prover's attestation.

## Acceptance criteria

- `UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK=6` splits a 30-module replay into 5 chunks; every module still replayed.
  (`test_replay_chunk_size_env_override_shrinks_chunks`.)
- A bad `UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK` (non-int / `0` / negative / empty) falls back to `30`.
  (`test_replay_chunk_size_env_invalid_falls_back_to_default`.)
- An unset `UNSORRY_REPLAY_CHUNK` is the `30` default.
  (`test_replay_chunk_size_env_unset_is_default`.)
- `gate-a.yml` and `gate-a-full-replay.yml` parse as valid YAML and define their jobs (workflow
  smoke-parse in CI / local `python3 -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)'`).
- The incremental scoping functions are untouched (existing `test_parallel_modules.py` incremental
  tests still pass).
