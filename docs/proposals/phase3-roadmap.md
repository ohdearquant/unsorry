# Phase 3 Roadmap (proposal)

Status: proposal / for discussion · 2026-06-10

Phase 2 demonstrated the loop *can* produce novel, kernel-verified mathematics: the machinery (decomposition, affinity/gap selection, the statement-binding gate) is built and red-team-proven, and the swarm proved its first mathlib-absent lemma (Nicomachus, [phase2-run-001](../metrics/phase2-run-001.md)). That is a proof of concept. Phase 3 asks the question a proof of concept cannot: **does it scale and sharpen?** Does a swarm pointed at genuinely hard, mathlib-absent targets grow the verified commons faster than people can — or does it stall at the elementary band?

This is a menu of the work that question breaks into, not a committed plan. The threads are roughly independent; pick the order by what we most want to learn.

## The honest gaps Phase 2 leaves

1. **Decomposition is demonstrated on paper, not in anger.** Nicomachus was proved *directly*; the decompose → prove-subs → recompose chain has unit tests and Gate-B guardrails but has never carried a proof the swarm couldn't one-shot. Until a real target forces it, "compounding" is a claim.
2. **No target *result*, only isolated lemmas.** The design doc's Phase 2 was "drive toward a chosen unformalised result by decomposition." We built the machinery and proved standalone lemmas; we have not yet pointed the swarm at one *result* and watched a dependency tree fill toward it.
3. **The library is unsorry's, not mathlib's.** The public good is only realised when a verified lemma lands *in the commons*. Right now nothing upstreams.
4. **One model, a few agents, the maintainer's account.** The "rag-tag heterogeneous swarm" is still aspirational at volume; authorship is by orchestration trail, not cryptography (ADR-007).
5. **Known inefficiencies.** Merge-lag duplicate fan-out wasted ~64% of cycles in `phase1-run-002`; absence is a grep pre-filter with a shelf life; Agent SDK credit economics are unbudgeted at scale.

## Candidate threads

### A. Force and prove decomposition (closest to done)
Drive the swarm at a target hard enough that a direct proof fails and decomposition *must* fire, then show the full chain close through Gate A. The [hard-target run](../metrics/) (Sophie Germain `n⁴+4`, the Platonic–Schläfli arithmetic core, …) is the first probe. **Exit:** at least one target reached *via* decompose → recompose, recorded end-to-end. This is the single most important gap to close — it turns "compounding" from a design claim into an observed fact.

### B. Drive to a chosen *result* through a dependency tree
Pick one unformalised result whose proof genuinely needs several lemmas in order (e.g. a closed-form via its Gauss-sum dependency, or a number-theory result built on 3–4 sub-lemmas), seed the target plus its dependency edges, and let affinity/gap selection route the swarm bottom-up. **Exit:** a target closed where the merged sub-lemmas were *reused* as importable dependencies — the compounding the architecture is named for.

### C. Upstream to mathlib (realise the public good)
A path from a verified `library/Unsorry/*.lean` lemma to a mathlib-ready PR: naming/style conformance, dedup against mathlib HEAD at submission time, and an artifact a human can open upstream. The value of the commons is only realised in the commons. **Open question:** how much of this can be automated vs. needs a human in the loop for mathlib review norms.

### D. Open the swarm to real contributors at volume
Invite external people to run agents on their own machines/subscriptions; observe claim-collision, merge-rate, and coordination dynamics at higher concurrency than the maintainer's few agents. Tests the design's core promise (untrusted, heterogeneous, rag-tag) for real. **Prereq:** the dedup fix below, or collision/merge churn will dominate.

### E. Harden the economics and the dedup
Fix the merge-lag duplicate fan-out (a "sha-already-in-library / claimed-by-me" short-circuit decoupled from the main-branch status flip — flagged in `phase1-run-002`); budget Agent SDK credit for sustained runs; consider a GitHub merge queue if volume grows. Unglamorous, but it is the difference between a demo and a service.

### F. Statement fidelity for research targets
For non-trivial targets the *formalisation* being faithful matters more than for trivia. Strengthen the dual-translation/fidelity gate (and the human-flag path) so a hard target's Lean statement provably captures its informal claim — the residue ADR-011 explicitly leaves to fidelity, not binding.

## Non-goals (unchanged)

Still not open conjectures — the swarm formalises existing proofs, it does not discover research-frontier mathematics. Still upstream of welfare — an enabling public good, not a direct one.

## A reasonable first move

**Thread A, then B.** Close the decomposition demonstration (it is nearly there and it is the load-bearing claim), then point the swarm at one real target *result* and watch the dependency tree compound. C (upstreaming) is the highest-leverage for *impact* but needs the most human-norm judgement; D/E/F are what make it a service rather than a demo. Each thread is an ADR + spec + a measured run, in the same idiom as Phases 0–2.
