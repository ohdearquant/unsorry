# swarm/run.sh — one-command governed swarm (ADR-058, SPEC-058-A; ADR-069).
#
# Runs the coordinated --prove flow as ONE command instead of three, so an
# operator launches the whole governed swarm at once:
#   * one DISPATCHER loop — ./swarm/agent.sh --dispatch-queue
#       opens queued/prove/* branches as admitted PRs when the submission
#       governor allows more verifier work. Ref-only (gh pr create --head);
#       never mutates the working-tree checkout.
#   * one SOURCER loop    — ./swarm/sourcing.sh --if-pool-empty   (ADR-069)
#       demand-driven goal sourcing: opens one chore(sourcing): PR ONLY when the
#       prove pool is empty (no goals/<slug>.aisp carries status≜open on the
#       synced main) and no-ops with exit 0 otherwise — the complement of the
#       prove arm's empty-pool stop (ADR-067), re-polled on an interval so it
#       fires exactly when, and only when, the provers run dry. This arm ADDS the
#       automatic empty-pool top-up only; it never gates manual sourcing —
#       `./swarm/sourcing.sh` (no flag) still sources on demand regardless of how
#       full the pool is. Default-on; UNSORRY_SOURCE_ON_EMPTY=0 omits it.
#   * one PROVER loop     — ./swarm/supervise.sh --prove "$@"
#       proves goals and pushes verified branches under queued/prove/ (queue mode
#       is the agent.sh default; relocates into a per-agent worktree, ADR-042);
#       resilient via ADR-017.
# All three inherit this shell's UNSORRY_* env and are torn down together on exit.
#
# Run exactly ONE dispatcher and ONE sourcer. For a multi-node swarm, run this
# once and start additional `./swarm/supervise.sh --prove` provers elsewhere — do
# not start more dispatchers or sourcers.
#
# NOTE: if the repository's scheduled `queue-dispatcher` workflow (.github/
# workflows/queue-dispatcher.yml) is enabled, IT is already that one dispatcher.
# Launching run.sh then adds a SECOND dispatcher. ADR-064 goal-level dedup makes
# this mostly safe — both read the same open-PR set and skip a goal already
# proved or already PR'd — but two passes can still both open a PR for the same
# goal inside the window before one is visible to the other (first-merge-wins
# then closes the loser as a conflict, wasting a Gate A slot). So on a repo with
# the scheduled dispatcher, run a prover only — `./swarm/supervise.sh --prove` —
# rather than run.sh. Use run.sh for a standalone/forked deployment that has no
# scheduled dispatcher (and so no scheduled sourcing either — its demand-driven
# sourcer arm is then the backlog's only automatic top-up).
#
# Usage:
#   ./swarm/run.sh [--goal <id>] [--provider <name>] [-pi [<model>]] [...]
# Args are passed through to the prover (see ./swarm/agent.sh --help).
#
# Environment (beyond the prover/dispatcher/sourcer's own UNSORRY_*):
#   UNSORRY_GOVERNOR_WAIT    dispatcher re-poll interval seconds (default 300)
#   UNSORRY_SOURCE_ON_EMPTY  launch the demand-driven sourcer arm (default on;
#                            0/false/no/off omits it — e.g. a deployment whose
#                            backlog is topped up by a scheduled sourcing job)
#   UNSORRY_SOURCING_WAIT    sourcer re-poll interval seconds (default 300)

swarm/run.sh — launch the governed swarm with a single command (ADR-058, ADR-069).

  ./swarm/run.sh [agent.sh --prove args]

Internally runs, sharing this shell's UNSORRY_* env, stopped together on exit:
  * dispatcher : ./swarm/agent.sh --dispatch-queue     (opens queued PRs)
  * sourcer    : ./swarm/sourcing.sh --if-pool-empty    (sources when pool empty)
  * prover     : ./swarm/supervise.sh --prove ...       (proves + queues branches)

The sourcer only ADDS automatic empty-pool top-up — `./swarm/sourcing.sh` (no
flag) still sources on demand regardless of pool depth. Disable the arm with
UNSORRY_SOURCE_ON_EMPTY=0.

Run ONE dispatcher and ONE sourcer; for more provers, start extra
`supervise.sh --prove` only.

Fork mode (ADR-068): run from a fork of agenticsnz/unsorry (auto-detected, or
forced with --fork / UNSORRY_FORK=1) and run.sh launches the PROVER ONLY — it
proves claimlessly and submits each proof as a cross-repo PR the upstream
re-verifies and auto-merges. No dispatcher or sourcer (a fork cannot open the
upstream's queued branches).

  --self-test   Run hermetic self-tests and exit (0 green / 1 red).
  -h, --help    Show this help.
