# swarm/run.sh — one-command governed swarm (ADR-058, SPEC-058-A).
#
# Runs the two halves of the coordinated --prove flow together, so an operator
# launches ONE command instead of two:
#   * one DISPATCHER loop — ./swarm/agent.sh --dispatch-queue
#       opens queued/prove/* branches as admitted PRs when the submission
#       governor allows more verifier work.
#   * one PROVER loop     — ./swarm/supervise.sh --prove "$@"
#       proves goals and pushes verified branches under queued/prove/ (queue
#       mode is the agent.sh default); resilient via ADR-017.
# Both inherit this shell's UNSORRY_* env and are torn down together on exit.
#
# Run exactly ONE dispatcher. For a multi-node swarm, run this once and start
# additional `./swarm/supervise.sh --prove` provers elsewhere — do not start
# more dispatchers.
#
# NOTE: if the repository's scheduled `queue-dispatcher` workflow (.github/
# workflows/queue-dispatcher.yml) is enabled, IT is already that one dispatcher.
# Launching run.sh then adds a SECOND dispatcher. ADR-064 goal-level dedup makes
# this mostly safe — both read the same open-PR set and skip a goal already
# proved or already PR'd — but two passes can still both open a PR for the same
# goal inside the window before one is visible to the other (first-merge-wins
# then closes the loser as a conflict, wasting a Gate A slot). So on a repo with
# the scheduled dispatcher, run a prover only — `./swarm/supervise.sh --prove` —
# rather than run.sh. Use run.sh for a standalone/forked deployment that has no
# scheduled dispatcher.
#
# Usage:
#   ./swarm/run.sh [--goal <id>] [--provider <name>] [-pi [<model>]] [...]
# Args are passed through to the prover (see ./swarm/agent.sh --help).

swarm/run.sh — launch the governed swarm with a single command (ADR-058).

  ./swarm/run.sh [agent.sh --prove args]

Internally runs, sharing this shell's UNSORRY_* env, stopped together on exit:
  * dispatcher : ./swarm/agent.sh --dispatch-queue   (opens queued PRs)
  * prover     : ./swarm/supervise.sh --prove ...     (proves + queues branches)

Run ONE dispatcher; for more provers, start extra `supervise.sh --prove` only.
