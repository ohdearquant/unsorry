"""Statement-binding gate (ADR-011, SPEC-011-A): regenerate the kernel binding
obligation for every proved goal, so Gate A — not the contributor — controls
what "proved this statement" means.

For each `library/index/<sha>.aisp` (a proved goal `<g>`), this writes
`library/Unsorry/<Camel>Binding.lean`:

    import Unsorry.<Camel>
    <open commands of goals/<g>.lean, if any>
    set_option linter.unusedVariables false in
    theorem <name>_binding_check : <∀-type of goals/<g>.lean> := <name>

The asserted type is the goal's own statement (`tools.lean_sig.foralltype`);
the proof term is the merged theorem. Gate A's `lake build UnsorryLibrary
--wfail` then builds these — and the obligation type-checks **iff** the proved
theorem's type is definitionally equal to (or more general than) the goal's. A
vacuous or weakened restatement under the goal's name — the #64 class — fails
to inhabit the goal type, so the binding build fails and Gate A goes red.

Because Gate A regenerates the bindings here from the goals (rather than
trusting a committed binding), a contributor cannot weaken or omit them.

Usage:
  python3 -m tools.gate_a.check_statement_binding generate <tree-root>
  python3 -m tools.gate_a.check_statement_binding clean    <tree-root>
