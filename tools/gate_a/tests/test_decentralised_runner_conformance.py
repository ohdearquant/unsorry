"""SPEC-049-A §5 conformance: the decentralised CI runner soundness invariant.

ADR-049 / SPEC-049-A push the expensive *elaboration* onto the untrusted
contributor (which ``swarm/agent.sh::prove_local_verify()`` already runs) and
keep a mandatory, cheap, **central** re-check as the *sole* load-bearing
soundness gate. The load-bearing invariant (SPEC-049-A §2) is a NEGATIVE one:

    the central re-check MUST NOT consume any contributor-supplied compiled
    artifact (``.olean``, exported term, hash, or manifest field) as a
    *trusted* input — it re-derives the statement from canonical goal source
    and re-elaborates the changed closure from source, then runs leanchecker /
    axiom audit / statement-binding over *that*.

The substantive scoping logic already exists (ADR-033 incremental replay/audit
in :mod:`tools.gate_a.parallel_modules`; ADR-045 olean cache), so these tests do
not re-implement it. They LOCK IN the soundness invariant as a regression guard
so a future "just leanchecker the client's olean" optimisation cannot silently
regress it — the two unsound classes ADR-049 §4 names: (i) crafted structurally
invalid oleans and (ii) real, type-correct proofs of a weaker/renamed statement
(the PR-#64 vacuity class). This is the Phase-0 deliverable in SPEC-049-A §6 —
the suite that must exist *before* any Phase-1 change narrows the central build.

Conformance-item references below point at SPEC-049-A §5 (and the §2 invariant).
Forward-looking items that depend on not-yet-built Phase-1 machinery are marked
xfail/skip rather than left failing: this repo gates merges on green CI, so an
"authored red" placeholder lands as an expected-failure marker that flips to
xpass when Phase 1 implements it.
