"""Render the sponsor's upstream packet (ADR-020, SPEC-020-A — stages 3+5).

A packet is everything the human sponsor needs to take one lemma to mathlib
honestly and efficiently — and nothing the sponsor is required to write from
scratch except the parts mathlib policy reserves for humans:

- `docs/upstream/<id>.md`: statement, the proposed mathlib-ready contribution
  block, dedup-at-HEAD evidence, provenance dossier, a paste-ready *factual*
  AI-disclosure block, and sponsor instructions with the rewrite-in-own-words
  boundary stated explicitly (LLM-written PR/Zulip narrative is against
  mathlib policy; the lemma itself, disclosed, is not).
- `docs/upstream/<id>.patch`: a `git apply`-able new-file diff against a
  mathlib checkout. The path `Mathlib/Unsorry/<Camel>.lean` is a deliberate
  placeholder — placement is a Zulip question, and the standalone file is
  exactly what `verify_head.sh` kernel-checks at HEAD.

Mechanical by design: structured facts only, no model access — CI can run it
nightly (SPEC-020-A automatic initiation).

Usage:
  python3 -m tools.upstream.packet --goal <id> [--root <repo>]
      [--dedup <report.json>] [--sponsor <name>] [--outdir docs/upstream]

## The statement (as proved here)

```lean
{statement}
```

Kernel-verified on `main`: `{_module_label(root, goal)}` (theorem `{name}`),
through Gate A (build `--wfail`, axiom audit against the standard whitelist, leanchecker
kernel replay, regenerated ADR-011 binding obligation).

## Proposed contribution

The `git apply`-able new-file diff is at [`{goal}.patch`]({goal}.patch). The target path
`Mathlib/Unsorry/{camel_name(goal)}.lean` is a **placeholder** — file placement and the
final name are Zulip questions, not ours to decide. Content:

```lean
{_contribution(root, goal, sponsor).rstrip()}
```
{dep_section}
## Dedup at mathlib HEAD

- mathlib revision scanned: `{dedup.get("mathlib_rev", "unknown")}`
- patterns: {", ".join(f"`{p}`" for p in dedup.get("patterns", [])) or "—"}
- verdict: **{dedup.get("verdict", "unknown")}**
- matches:
{match_lines}

A name-grep is a pre-filter, not a proof of absence; the kernel build at HEAD
(`tools/upstream/verify_head.sh`) is the strong evidence and its result belongs in the
PR conversation.

## Provenance dossier

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
{provenance_rows}

Proof produced by an autonomous Claude agent swarm (model policy ADR-013/ADR-015:
`fable`, progressive effort), merged with no human review through two CI gates
(ADR-006 soundness, Gate B hygiene). Full machine history: the goal's PR trail in
this repository.

## AI disclosure (paste-ready facts)

> The Lean proof in this PR was produced by an autonomous LLM agent
> (Anthropic Claude, model `fable`) operating in the `unsorry` proof swarm
> (github.com/agenticsnz/unsorry), and was machine-verified there by kernel
> replay, an axiom audit against the standard whitelist (`propext`,
> `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`), and a CI-regenerated statement-binding
> obligation. I have read and understood the proof in full and can justify
> each step without AI assistance. Label: `LLM-generated`.

## For the sponsor

1. Read the proof until you can justify every step **without AI assistance** —
   mathlib reviewers will expect exactly that.
2. **Zulip first**, in your own words: is the lemma wanted, where does it live,
   what should it be called? The PR-description narrative and every review reply
   likewise **must be rewritten in your own words** — mathlib policy forbids
   LLM-written conversation; only the lemma itself (disclosed) and the factual
   disclosure block above may be pasted.
3. **Raise the draft PR with one command** once you've done 1–2 — from the
   unsorry repo root:
   ```
   python3 -m tools.upstream.raise_pr --goal {goal} --fork <your-github-user> --understood
   ```
   It clones mathlib master, applies the patch to a fresh branch, pushes to
   your fork, and opens a **draft** PR pre-filled with the factual disclosure
   and a placeholder where your narrative goes. (`--understood` is your
   attestation that you've read the proof; `--dry-run` shows the plan first.)
   The machine never marks it ready and never writes a review reply.
4. Write your narrative in the draft, apply the `LLM-generated` label, then
   **you** flip draft → ready. Expect the linter to want golfing (binder
   names, line length) — that editing is yours. See [docs/upstreaming.md](../upstreaming.md).
5. Record the outcome on the targets board (`in-discussion → pr-open →
   merged | declined`). **Declined is a valid, recorded result.**
